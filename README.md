The gallery is ready! You can view it by opening the index.html file in the public folder. The public folder contains all the files you need for your gallery and you can host it on any static hosting provider.

Note Your photos and videos are copied in public/images/photos.

Optionally, you can directly publish the gallery on Netlify, which offers a free plan.



Simple Photo Gallery is developed by Srikanta Mahanta. I wanted an easy way to share photos with friends, but wasn't happy with the limited customization options that existing sharing solutions like Amazon Photos or iCloud offer.

Please contact me on Twitter if you have any questions, ideas for improvement or feature requests.
